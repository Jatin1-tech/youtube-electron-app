# YouTube Desktop App 🎬

A sleek desktop YouTube wrapper built with Electron.js that bypasses DNS-level restrictions and provides a native app experience.

❓ Why I Made This
YouTube isn’t available as a native app on the Windows store. I use DNS filters for privacy/safety, but they restrict YouTube when applied to the browser. So I made this app using Electron to run YouTube as its own standalone desktop experience — DNS-free, smooth, and silent.

## 🎯 Why This App?

- **Bypass DNS Filters**: Works around CleanBrowsing and similar DNS-level YouTube blocks

## 🔧 Configuration

### DNS Settings
The app uses Cloudflare's DNS-over-HTTPS by default. You can modify the DNS servers in `main.js`:

```javascript
app.commandLine.appendSwitch('dns-over-https-servers', 'https://your-dns-server.com/dns-query');
```

### Window Customization
Adjust window properties in `main.js`:

```javascript
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  width: 1200,        // Adjust width
  height: 800,        // Adjust height
  title: "YouTube",   // Window title
  // ... other options
});
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App doesn't start silently**
- Try using `YouTube.vbs` instead of `start.bat`
- Ensure Node.js is properly installed and in PATH

**Login issues**
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try logging in through your default browser first

**DNS blocking still active**
- Check if your DNS provider blocks DoH requests
- Try changing DNS servers in the configuration
